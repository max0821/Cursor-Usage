## ‚ú® Features

This script addresses the official dashboard's lack of detailed statistics and trend analysis by providing the following core features:

- **üìä Interactive Floating Panel**:
  - The interface can be freely dragged and positioned anywhere on the screen.
  - All data is presented in a single, easy-to-read panel.

- **üìà Detailed Data Statistics**:
  - **Request Count**: Counts all successfully billed requests.
  - **Token Analysis**: Precisely calculates the total amount of Input, Output, Cache Read, and Cache Write tokens.
  - **Total Cost**: Sums up all costs, providing an accurate total in USD, precise to four decimal places.

- **üìÖ Flexible Date Queries**:
  - **Quick Buttons**: Provides one-click access to common time ranges like "Today," "7 Days," and "30 Days."
  - **Custom Date Picker**: Features an interactive calendar, allowing you to select any custom date range for analysis.
  - **Smart Memory**: Automatically saves your last selected date range and loads it the next time you open the page.

- **üìâ Visualized Trend Chart**:
  - Includes a built-in daily cost line chart powered by [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).
  - Visualizes your total costs on a day-by-day basis, helping you easily identify usage peaks and troughs.

- **üöÄ Robust and Reliable Data Fetching**:
  - **Automatic Pagination**: When usage records exceed one page, the script automatically fetches all subsequent pages in the background and merges the data, ensuring 100% complete statistics.
  - **Smart Filtering**: Automatically excludes all non-billed, errored, or user-API-key-generated requests to ensure the purity of the statistical scope.
  - **Timezone Synchronization**: All date calculations are based on the **UTC+0** standard, perfectly aligning with Cursor's official backend logic to eliminate data discrepancies caused by time differences.
